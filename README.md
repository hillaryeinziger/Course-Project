Course-Project
==============
The R script in this repository, run_analysis.R, will take the data from the UCI HAR Dataset, extract the data corresponding to the means and standard deviations of measurements, find the mean of each variable for each subject/activity pair, and save the data in a tidy data set, tidydata.txt.

In order for this script to run properly, it must be saved in the working directory.  The working directory must also contain the UCI HAR Dataset folder, downloaded and unzipped from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  You must also have the R packages dplyr and tidyr installed.
